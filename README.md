Overview
This is a native Android application developed using Clean Architecture principles. Clean Architecture is an architectural approach that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by dividing the application into layers based on their responsibilities.

Architecture

Presentation Layer: Contains UI components such as Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels. Responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interactions.

Data Layer: Deals with data access and manipulation. Includes repositories, data sources, and API clients.
